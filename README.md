## Introduction

Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Jakarta EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time. This course covers the latest version of Spring 6.

Spring Boot is the modern development approach for building enterprise application. Spring Boot minimizes the configuration required for setting up Spring projects. By using Spring Boot, you can accelerate your development speed and leverage the auto-configuration features. This course covers the latest version of Spring Boot 3.

This course covers Spring Core, Annotations, All Java Spring Configuration, Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring REST, Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. 

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. The modules are as follows:

1. Spring Boot 3 Quick Start
2. Spring Core
3. Hibernate/JPA CRUD
4. REST CRUD APIs
5. REST API Security
6. Spring MVC
7. Spring MVC CRUD
8. Spring MVC Security
9. JPA/Hibernate Advanced Mappings
10. AOP - Aspect Oriented Programming
